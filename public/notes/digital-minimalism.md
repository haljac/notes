# Digital Minimalism

Digital minimalism is about being more intentional with technology. It's not about rejecting all digital tools, but choosing them carefully.

Here's a simple Python script for tracking digital usage:

```python
def track_screen_time(hours):
    """Track daily screen time and provide recommendations."""
    if hours < 2:
        return "Great! You're practicing digital minimalism."
    elif hours < 4:
        return "Good balance, but consider reducing further."
    else:
        return "Time to implement some digital boundaries."

# Example usage
daily_hours = 3.5
recommendation = track_screen_time(daily_hours)
print(f"Screen time: {daily_hours}h - {recommendation}")
```

And a shell script for digital decluttering:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Digital declutter script

echo "Starting digital declutter..."

# Clean up downloads folder
find ~/Downloads -type f -mtime +30 -delete

# Clear browser cache (example for macOS)
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/com.google.Chrome

echo "Declutter complete!"
```

## Core Principles

1. **Intentionality** - Choose tools that serve your values
2. **Focus** - Reduce digital clutter and distractions  
3. **Craft** - Value quality over convenience

## In Practice

- Turn off unnecessary notifications
- Create device-free zones and times
- Choose high-quality over high-quantity content
- Regular digital decluttering

Here's a JavaScript function for implementing focus sessions:

```javascript
class FocusSession {
    constructor(duration = 25) {
        this.duration = duration; // minutes
        this.isActive = false;
    }
    
    start() {
        if (this.isActive) {
            console.log("Focus session already active!");
            return;
        }
        
        this.isActive = true;
        console.log(`Starting ${this.duration}-minute focus session...`);
        
        setTimeout(() => {
            this.end();
        }, this.duration * 60 * 1000);
    }
    
    end() {
        this.isActive = false;
        console.log("Focus session complete! Time for a break.");
    }
}

// Usage
const session = new FocusSession(25);
session.start();
```

The goal isn't to use less technology, but to use it better.
